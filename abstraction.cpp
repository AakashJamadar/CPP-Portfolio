#include <iostream>

//Abstraction:It involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary and relevant parts to the user. 

//Advantages

//1.only you can make changes to your data or functions and else no one can as other don't even have the idea of it
//2.It makes the application secure by not allowing anyone else to see the background details
//3.Increases the reusability of the code,ie avoids the duplication of the code

//Implementation example is getter and setter for private members
